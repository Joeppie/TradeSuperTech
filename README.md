Improved Trade Modules in Avorion: all of them will tell you all they can know about prices.

This is an improved version of the advanced trade module mod (which I fixed to be compatible with the latest Avorion version to date). Every trade module will provide all the information the top-tier version of the trade module can.
The only limitation left in place is the number of sectors for which information is stored.

## Normal fixed version:

A fixed version that incoprorates the original features with the additions made to the base game regarding to trade is found here:
